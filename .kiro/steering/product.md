# Product: NimbusAI
## Problem Statement
Designing cloud infrastructure is fragmented. Diagrams, code, costs, and security audits live in different tools.

## Product Philosophy
- **Unification**: One tool for design, code, cost, and security.
- **Explainability**: AI must explain *why* decisions were made.
- **Determinism**: The same prompt should lead to consistent, production-ready architecture.
- **Visual-First**: Infrastructure is best understood through visualization.

## Target Users
- DevOps Engineers
- Cloud Architects
- Developers who need rapid, secure AWS deployments.
